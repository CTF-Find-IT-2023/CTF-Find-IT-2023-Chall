# Description
Hi, you're a cryptography nerd, right? Long story short, I want to join this C00L KIDZ KLUB but in order to get in, I need to encode the phrase "HAPPY SWEET SEVENTEEN FREDDIE" with this tool they lend me? I don't get it! They also gave me a text file as a clue? I don't even know what these jumbled words are talking about!

Notes:
Answer is in all capital letters, but don't forget the usual format of FindITCTF{I_AM_INSIDE_YOUR_WALLS}

Hint:
1. The alphabet index starts from 0 all the way to 25
