## Description
Your friend is a lazy developer who likes spiders a lot for some reasons. One day, he is making a new, refined app called new_spider. He brags about how this app is so sophisticated it can give you a flag by using one of its function. Sadly, it is yet to be implemented. CAn you, by force, make the program run the yet to be implemented function?  

Hint:
1. Check the manual page of readelf or objdump
